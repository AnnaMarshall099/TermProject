# Expense Tracker
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/yk_jF2X13A4> 
#### Description: This project is a Python application that reads expense data from a CSV file and allows users to view and total expenses by vendor or category for selected months, using object-oriented design for flexible data management.


This project reads some expenses from a CSV file. The CSV file contains a row for each vendor, with an additional column for the vendor’s category and then additional columns for all of the vendor’s expenses by month. When the application is started, the user is prompted “Would you like to see expenses by Vendor (v) or by Category (c), or exit (x)?” If v is entered, it lists all of the vendors and prompts “Enter vendor ID or 'x' to exit:” The user can enter an ID such as 2. It then prompts “Enter months for which you want to see the data:” The user can enter any combination of months, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it produces the expenses for each individual month, January through May, as well as the total. Any key can be pressed to then continue back to the main menu:  “Would you like to see expenses by Vendor (v) or by Category (c), or exit (x)?” If c is entered, it lists categories and states “Enter category or 'x' to exit:” Once a category is chosen, it asks which months’ expenses are wanted, which behaves identically to the vendor months. The user can then exit. When exit (x) is chosen at the main menu, it says “Goodbye!” This detailed information allows the user to budget and look at their expenses in a targeted, specific way.

There are five files in this project: `TermProject.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Expenses.csv`, `Test.csv`, and `.env`. `TermProject.py` runs the actual program. It contains all of the logic and functions. The `requirements.txt` file lists the external libraries required to run the project. The `.env` file contains environment variables so that they are not hardcoded in the application itself. In this case, it tells the program to use the file named `Expense.csv` as the expense data source. The `Test.csv` file was a test file that contained only a few vendors. This allowed me to test the program without using the full CSV file, simplifying debugging any problems it had. The `Expenses.csv` contained the full information on all the expenses, vendors, and categories for 2024.

There were several key design decisions. The first was to use classes for Vendor and MonthlyVendorExpense. Classes are a critical part of object-oriented programming. They allow the programmer to group related data and functions together. Each vendor in the Vendor class has an ID, a name, and a category. In the MonthlyVendorExpense, each expense has a vendorID, a month, and an amount. This helps keep the code readable and clean. Using classes also makes the code easier to maintain. It’s possible to modify one class without changing others, which also helps in finding and fixing errors. For the vendor Category, however, a simple string attribute made more sense than a class, since it is a descriptive element and not an object. Finally, using a separate file for the expenses makes it simple to read in a different year if desired, or in this case, a test file.
